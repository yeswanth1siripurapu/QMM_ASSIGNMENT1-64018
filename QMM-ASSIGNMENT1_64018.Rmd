#Summary:
#a) A maximum revenue of $1780 can be achieved by making 40 artisanal truffles,
#12 handmade chocolate nuggets, and 4 chocolate bars.
#b) Chocolate bars, handmade chocolate nuggets, and artisanal truffles 
#constrain binding.
#c)In terms of fliesability, artisanal truffles have a shadow price of $2 and a
#range of 47.5 to 51.6 pounds.
#c) Made-to-Order Chocolate Nuggets: Shadow Price = $30,
#Range of Fiesability = 30 to 52 Pounds e)
#Chocolate Bars: Shadow Price = $6, Range of Fiesability = 29.1 to 50 Pounds
#d) Range of Optimality: Artisanal Truffles = $20 to $38,
#Handmade Chocolate Nuggets = $22.5 to $26.67
#and Chocolate Bars = $18.75 to $35.00

#chocolate bars. Before examining other output values, think about using a
#different method to input the problem formuation. We will construct a text file 
#containing the problem formulation in the LP format. The write.lp statement was
#used to create an lp file as well. Let's now examine the choclate.lp file.
